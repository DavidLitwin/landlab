        Paths represent the temporal connectivity of zones. The returned
        DataFrame describes all of the paths of the inputted zones. The origin
        of a path is a prior zone. The destinations of a path are the
        zones that spatially intersect the prior zone.

        Path type is determined by the number of zone connections between the
        prior and current timesteps. The path type refers to these connects and
        is designated by a string with the pattern, x-to-y where x and y are
        the descriptive counts (none, one, or many) of zone(s) at the prior and
        current timestep, respectively. For example, a path type of one-to-many
        is a zone in the prior timestep that was fragmented into many zones in
        the current timestep.

        In any of the `many` path type, a rule determines which of the prior
        zones persist as the zone in the current timestep. The zone with the
        greatest area of intersection between the prior and current timesteps
        persists to the current timestep along with the others in `new_zones`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        prior_zones : Zone list
            The zones of the prior timestep.
        new_patches : Zone list
